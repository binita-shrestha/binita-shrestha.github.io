  I am a Learner 
  <br><br>
  I have a Masterâ€™s degree in Water Resources Engineering and currently enrolled as a CS grad student. I started my career as an H&H Engineer in 2021. I have 4 years of experience with several phases of FEMA Risk Mapping: Base Level Engineering (BLE 2D HEC-RAS modeling), Discovery (Technical report, Community Outreach, Documentation), Hydrologic analysis (RRE flow calculation), Hydraulic analysis (1D HEC-RAS riverine modeling, floodway study), and QA QC. I am also experienced in Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) dam inundation modeling (combined 1D-2D RAS models), identification of areas of mitigation interest (AOMI, FEMA non-reg products), and Natural Resources Conservation Services (NRCS) watershed assessment project (hydrologic modeling in HSPF: BASIN45).
